## Required Software

- (required) GNU C++
- (required) The LAPACK and BLAS libraries
This library is available for most platforms.
The configure.pl script will ask for the LDFLAGS variable
to pass to the compiler/linker. If the linux platform was
chosen the default/suggested LDFLAGS will include -llapack.
If the osx platform was chosen the default/suggested LDFLAGS will
include  -framework Accelerate.
For other platforms the appropriate linker flags must be given.
More information on LAPACK is here: http://netlib.org/lapack/
- (required) PsimagLite. This is here \url{https://github.com/g1257/PsimagLite/}.
You can do \verb=git clone https://github.com/g1257/PsimagLite.git= in a separate directory
outside of the DMRG++ distribution. \verb=configure.pl= will ask you where you put it.
- (optional) make or gmake (only needed to use the Makefile)
- (optional) perl (only needed to run the configure.pl script)
